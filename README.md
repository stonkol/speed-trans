### Step 1: Install Python (macOS)
Ensure that you have Python installed. If not, you can install it using Homebrew:
`brew install python`

### Step 2: Install Required Python Packages
`pip3 install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`

### In the Python code
Replace 'your_target_language' with the language code you want to translate to (e.g., 'es' for Spanish).

## Note:
Ensure that the file you want to translate (your_input_file.txt) is in the same directory as your script or provide the correct path.
Using automated translation have limitations, and it is recommended to review it manually.
